# Fully fledged web-based platforms for social networks, shopping sites and more

For virtually 10 years, I was developing national online social network services which hosted millions of users. In 2001, I started to develop one of the first blogging services in my home country called IranBlog. In 2006, I developed the first Twitter-like service in my country that had Facebook-style social network capabilities named Peyghamak. These projects were developed based on distributed computing concepts where the service could scale up on demand. For this reason, I developed a course to teach students with web design and development at university. I was with World Wide Web (W3) since its beginning days.

There are two other projects: a) BookStotre is a complete portal for a bookstore with online payment, and b) News is portal for news management within a news organisation such as a newspaper, etc.

The databases of all these websites were designed using MSSQL/MYSQL with stored procedures in order to increase performance as much as possible.
